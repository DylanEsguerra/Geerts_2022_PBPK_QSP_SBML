## Model Architecture

The model is implemented using a modular architecture where individual biological processes are separated into distinct modules. This approach provides several advantages:

- **Modularity**: Each biological process can be developed and validated independently
- **Flexibility**: Components can be easily modified or replaced
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes debugging easier
- **Reusability**: Modules can be reused in different model configurations

### Multiple Implementation Approaches

1. **SBML-based Implementation**: Uses Systems Biology Markup Language for model representation
2. **Direct ODE Implementation**: JAX-based ODE system directly translated from published equations

## ODE to Reactions Translation

A key aspect of this implementation is the translation from published ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to reaction-based SBML format. This translation required several important considerations:

### Mass Units Conversion
The original Geerts model uses concentration units (nM), but SBML reactions work best with mass units. Our implementation:
- Converts all concentrations to mass units using compartment volumes
- Maintains consistency across all reactions and rate constants
- Validates the conversion by comparing with direct ODE implementation

### Reaction Network Construction
Each ODE term is translated into corresponding reactions:
- Production terms become synthesis reactions
- Degradation terms become degradation reactions  
- Transport terms become transport reactions between compartments
- Binding interactions become association/dissociation reaction pairs
- Some Rate Rules / Assignment Rules are still required for time dependent terms 
    - Microglia Cell Count
    - IDE clearance rate 
    - Antibody Dosing forcing function 

### Rate Constant Handling
Rate constants are carefully managed to ensure:
- Proper units (converted from concentration-based to mass-based rates)
- Appropriate scaling for compartment volumes

## Key Technical Components

### Rate Constant Extrapolation

The model uses sophisticated rate extrapolation implemented in `K_rates_extrapolate.py`:

![K_rates_extrapolate](generated/figures/K_Rates_Extrapolate.png)

*Forward and Backward rate constants for higher order aggregates extrapolated from experimentally determined low order rates. This file also creates the ùêπùëñùëèùêπùëúùëüùê¥ùëó rates used for direct formation of Plaques from higher order oligomers. This section of the model has minimal information in the supplement and has required significant assumptions to be made.*



**Key Features:**
- Uses experimentally determined rates for small oligomers as anchor points
- Handles AŒ≤40 and AŒ≤42 separately with different aggregation propensities
- Defines $\text{FibForAj}$ rates as $K_{\text{O13\_Plaque\_42}} = K_{\text{O13\_O14\_42}} \times \text{Baseline\_AB42\_Oligomer\_Fibril\_Plaque}$ using Oligomer_13 as an example
- **Note**: Backward rates are not provided in the original supplement and are copied from referenced paper [Garai 2013](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1222478110?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed)
- **Note**: Found issues with Garai Rates including one issue in publication itself and another discrepancy between rate in Geerts and published rate
    - Garai et al. 2013 Figure 7 fails for published value of dimer to trimer rate for Abeta 42: k+23 (kf1 in Geerts) = 38 (M‚Åª¬πs‚Åª¬π), but is reproducible with k+23 = 380 (M‚Åª¬πs‚Åª¬π)
    - Geerts TableS2 cites Garai for kf0 and kf1, but is missing kb0 and kb1
    - Geerts TableS2 has kf0 ABeta 42 = 0.0003564 nM/h = 9.9 (M‚Åª¬πs‚Åª¬π) when Garai has 9.9 (M‚Åª¬πs‚Åª¬π) √ó 10¬≤

The full rate extrapolation is shown below with oligomer size on the x-axis. Notice that for AŒ≤42, the backward rate consistently exceeds the forward rate throughout the size range. We believe this imbalance is responsible for the overabundance of monomers and failure to aggregate effectively.

![Rate Extrapolation](generated/figures/rate_extrapolation_garai.png)

Through sensitivity analysis of the low-order backward rates omitted from the Geerts supplement, we determined that the reported values for AŒ≤42 in Garai 2013 are likely much higher than physiologically realistic. The table below compares the original Garai values with our adjusted parameters:

| Parameter | Garai 2013 | Our Model |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| k_O2_M_42 | 45.72 | 45.72 |
| k_O3_O2_42 | 1.08 | 1E-05 |

We maintained the dimer-to-monomer rate at the original value but reduced the trimer-to-dimer rate to the reported cutoff threshold for backward rates. This deviation from the original Garai rates was essential to capture age-dependent aggregation behavior, which is crucial for this model's physiological relevance.


![Modified Rate Extrapolation](generated/figures/rate_extrapolation.png)

With these adjustments, the forward rate now exceeds the backward rate for both AŒ≤40 and AŒ≤42 species, enabling proper aggregation dynamics.

- **Note** Similar bahvior can be reacted by lowering k_O2_M_42 or increasing low order forwarded rates. 

### IDE Clearance Decline with Age

The model implements age-dependent decline in insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) clearance in the equation for monomer dynamics:

![Abeta 42 Monomer](generated/figures/Abeta42_M_equation.png)

The clearance term has its own time-dependent behavior 
![IDE](generated/figures/IDE_CL.png)

**Important Note**: This age-dependent decline is mentioned in the main publication but the specific equation and parameters are not provided in Supplementary Table 2. 

```
# This term is represented here as it is in TableS2 without the slope or time dependent behavior

 -(IDE_conc * AB42_IDE_Kcat_lin * ((AB42_Monomer * Unit_removal_1)^AB42_IDE_Hill / ((AB42_Monomer * Unit_removal_1)^AB42_IDE_Hill 

```

No equation is given to show how clearance changes with age so we chose to implement one based on the IDE equation from the main paper. A linear slope was unavailable in the supplement so we chose to use the published exponential decline rate. 

### Individual Oligomer Tracking

The model tracks individual oligomer species (2-mers through 24-mers) rather than using averaged pools. This provides:

- **Detailed Species Resolution**: Each oligomer size has distinct kinetic properties
- **Size-Dependent Behavior**: Aggregation and clearance rates vary with oligomer size  
- **Validation Capability**: Individual species can be compared with experimental data
- **Mechanistic Insight**: Understanding of aggregation cascade progression


### Microglia Dynamics with Dosing

Microglia activation responds to antibody-bound amyloid:

*Results for Gantenerumab 3-year study with dosing every 4 weeks for 1.5 years*

**Dynamic Features:**
- Baseline activation level in absence of treatment
- Enhanced activation in response to antibody-bound AŒ≤
- Cell population dynamics
- Clearance capacity modulation

## Model Generation and Execution

### Generation Process

1. **Module Combination**: `Combined_Master_Model.py` merges all modules
2. **SBML Export**: Generated model saved as XML in `generated/sbml/`
3. **JAX Conversion**: SBML converted to JAX format using `sbml_to_ode_jax`
4. **Validation**: Cross-validation with direct ODE implementation

2. Convert to JAX format  
3. Run steady-state simulation (no dose)
4. Use steady-state as initial condition
5. Apply dosing schedule
6. Generate comprehensive outputs
```

#### No-Dose Simulation
```
1. Generate model without dosing components
2. Run long-term simulation (20-100 years)
3. Focus on natural AŒ≤ aggregation dynamics
4. Useful for parameter sensitivity analysis
```

### Solver Configuration

The model uses sophisticated ODE solvers:
- **Primary Solver**: Tsit5 (5th order Runge-Kutta)
- **JAX Integration**: Leverages JAX for automatic differentiation 
- **Diffrax Backend**: Modern ODE solving with advanced numerical methods

## Technical Limitations and Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Aggregation Dynamics**: Investigating discrepancies in AŒ≤ aggregation behavior
2. **Parameter Uncertainty**: Some parameters lack direct experimental validation
3. **Computational Cost**: Full model has significant runtime for long simulations
4. **Dosing in Tellurium**: Currently the use of Tellurium helps reduce runtime significantly for our no dose simulations, but we are unable to get the dosing scheduale to work using this tool. 

### Ongoing Validation

- Parameter sensitivity analysis using Tellurium framework
- Comparison with published experimental data
- Investigation of aggregation pathway parameters
